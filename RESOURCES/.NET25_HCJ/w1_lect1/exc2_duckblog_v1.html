        <h2> How to Code Without Hands</h1>
            Quack! Let me tell you, being a rubber duck in a world of keyboards is not exactly ergonomic. When humans
            code, they
            use fingers. When I code, I have to waddle across the keys and hope the autocorrect is feeling generous.

            But here's the thing: coding isn't about hands, it's about imagination, problem-solving, and occasionally
            yelling at
            the computer until it behaves. And yelling is something I excel at!

            Every day, I roll up my tiny wings and commit to learning something new. HTML? Easy, it's like building a
            nest, but
            with tags. CSS? Fashion for websites, and I do look fabulous. JavaScript? Well... sometimes it quacks back
            when I
            least expect it.

            So if you ever think something is impossible, remember: a waterproof bird with no fingers is out here
            writing code.
            If I can do it, you definitely can! ❤️

        <h1>Debugging: My Natural Talent</h1>
        I may not write all the code myself (webbed feet aren't great for typing), but debugging? That is where I shine.
        Programmers come to me, set me next to their keyboard, and start explaining their bugs. And before they know
        it...
        the bug vanishes. It's almost like magic, except it's science! Rubber duck science!

        You see, when humans talk through their code step-by-step, they suddenly notice the exact spot where things go
        "splat" instead of "quack". But do I ever get credit? Rarely. Do I demand glory? Only sometimes.

        The truth is, debugging isn't about blaming the duck — it's about learning to think like one: calm, floaty, and
        always watching for hidden hazards in the code pond.

        So next time your code misbehaves, don't panic! Grab your nearest rubber duck (preferably me), talk it out, and
        float your way to cleaner code!

        <h1>Favorite Programming Languages</h1>
        As a stylish rubber duck, I really appreciate CSS. It's all about looks! Padding? Borders? Drop-shadows? Yes
        please,
        every element deserves to feel as fabulous as I do!

        HTML is wonderful too. It gives structure to the pond... er, page. Without HTML, everything would just be one
        soggy
        pile of text sinking to the bottom of the browser.

        JavaScript and I have a... complicated relationship. Sometimes it makes websites interactive and fun. Other
        times it
        throws mysterious errors like "undefined is not a function" and swims away giggling.

        In the end, I think every language has its charm. Except maybe that one humans wrote as a prank. You know the
        one.
        (Yes, I mean brainf**k!) 💀
